# Virtual-Drummer
Virtual Drummer is a simple project that uses VST3 technology to send MIDI information created in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to a Unity program able to animate this information in 3D. It uses TCP/IP sockets for communication between the plugin and Unity and it uses the VST3 interface to communicate with the DAW.
